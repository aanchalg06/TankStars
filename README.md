# Tank Stars - Multiplayer 2D Game

**Java, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), LibGDX**

## Overview

Tank Stars is a multiplayer 2D game developed using **Java** and the **LibGDX** framework. Inspired by the popular game Tank Stars, this project implements a two-player mode where players face off on hilly terrain, taking turns to fire bombs at one another. The game incorporates a range of tanks, weapons, and a save/load feature that allows players to resume their game at any point.

## Features

- **Two-Player Mode:** Engage in 1v1 battles where players take turns to shoot at each other until one tank is destroyed.
- **Tank Selection:** Choose from at least three different tanks, each with unique capabilities.
- **Trajectory Control:** Adjust the power and angle of your shots to maximize impact.
- **Save & Load:** Ability to save the game state, including tank positions, health, and terrain, and load it later.
- **Health Display:** Real-time display of tank health on the game screen.
- **Pause Menu:** Options to pause the game, save the current state, or return to the main menu.
- **Serialization:** Game state management using Serialization and Deserialization principles.

## Additional Features

- **Special Weapon Drops:** Gain weapon upgrades through random airdrops during the game.
- **Tank Movement:** Tanks move based on the impact of the hit, adding a layer of strategy to positioning.

## Gameplay

### Main Menu:

- **New Game:** Start a new 1v1 match.
- **Resume Game:** Load a previously saved game.
- **Exit:** Exit the game.

### In-Game:

- **Fire:** Take turns firing at your opponent until one tank is destroyed.
- **Pause Menu:** Access options to save, resume, or exit to the main menu.

## Requirements

- **Java 8+**
- **LibGDX Framework**

## Motivation

This project was created to enhance understanding of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles and game development using **LibGDX**. It challenges developers to implement game mechanics, serialization, and an intuitive UI, providing a rich learning experience.
